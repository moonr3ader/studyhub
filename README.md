# 📚 StudyHub – Learning Resources Manager  
StudyHub is a beginner-friendly project designed to practice **JavaScript fundamentals** and **React concepts** in a structured, weekly approach.  
By the end of 4 weeks, you will build a functional app where users can **search, organize, and track learning resources**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Learn and apply **JavaScript concepts** (arrays, recursion, strings, linked lists).
- Build a **React app step-by-step**, focusing on one core concept per week.
- Create a **complete project** that evolves and improves each week.
- Practice **props drilling, API calls, JSX rendering, and conditional rendering**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (JSX, conditional rendering, props)
- **Language**: JavaScript (arrays, recursion, strings, linked lists)
- **API**: OpenLibrary API / Quotable API (or any free public API)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (optional) or plain CSS

---

## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

### **Week 1 – Arrays, Searching & Sorting + JSX**
- **Goal**: Display and manage a static list of resources.
- **Features**:
  - Static dataset of learning resources (title, category, difficulty, rating).
  - Search bar → filter list by title or category.
  - Sorting (e.g., by difficulty or rating).
  - Display resources in cards or a table using JSX.
- **Deliverable**: Searchable & sortable resource list.

---

### **Week 2 – Recursion + Conditional Rendering**
- **Goal**: Add nested categories and collapsible views.
- **Features**:
  - Resource categories structured like folders (e.g., Programming → JavaScript → React).
  - Recursively render nested categories/resources.
  - Expand/collapse functionality using conditional rendering.
- **Deliverable**: Folder-style navigation to browse resources.

---

### **Week 3 – Strings + API Calls**
- **Goal**: Integrate an API for resource search.
- **Features**:
  - Input box for searching new resources.
  - Fetch results from a free API (e.g., OpenLibrary or Quotable).
  - Process and clean strings (capitalize, trim, highlight matches).
  - Display search results along with the static list.
- **Deliverable**: API-powered search with string formatting.

---

### **Week 4 – Linked List + Props Drilling**
- **Goal**: Add a study queue manager with undo/redo.
- **Features**:
  - Implement a Linked List structure (`Node`, `LinkedList` class).
  - Users can add/remove resources to a "study queue."
  - Undo/redo functionality by traversing the linked list.
  - Share resource/task state across multiple components (props drilling).
- **Deliverable**: Study queue manager with undo/redo navigation.

---

## 🚀 Final Outcome
By the end of Week 4, StudyHub will include:
1. **Array searching & sorting** of resources.  
2. **Recursive category browsing** with conditional rendering.  
3. **API-powered search** with string manipulation.  
4. **Linked list–based study queue** with undo/redo and props drilling.

---

## ⏱️ Time Plan
Each week = **3–4 days × ~3 hours/day = 9–12 hours**
- **Day 1**: Learn concepts + set up core logic.
- **Day 2**: Implement React components.
- **Day 3**: Style & refine functionality.
- **Day 4 (optional)**: Stretch goals or polish.

---

## 🌱 Stretch Goals
- Add **localStorage** to save the study queue.
- Visualize the **linked list** (nodes with arrows).
- Add user authentication (e.g., Firebase) to store resources.
